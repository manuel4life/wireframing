# Wireframing in UI/UX Design

## What is Wireframing?
Wireframing is the process of creating simplified visual guides that represent the skeletal framework of a digital interface. It focuses on layout, functionality, and user flow without visual design elements.

## Importance of Wireframing
1. **Clarifies Structure**: Defines page hierarchy and element placement
2. **Saves Time**: Identifies usability issues early in the design process
3. **Facilitates Feedback**: Provides stakeholders with a clear, focused view of functionality
