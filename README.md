# Wireframing in UI/UX Design

## What is Wireframing?
Wireframing is the process of creating simplified visual guides that represent the skeletal framework of a digital interface. It focuses on layout, functionality, and user flow without visual design elements.

## Importance of Wireframing
1. **Clarifies Structure**: Defines page hierarchy and element placement
2. **Saves Time**: Identifies usability issues early in the design process
3. **Facilitates Feedback**: Provides stakeholders with a clear, focused view of functionality

## Key Elements of Wireframing

1. **Layout Structure**  
   Defines the arrangement of components (e.g., header, footer, sidebar).  
   *Example: A 3-column layout for an e-commerce site prioritizes product visibility.*

2. **Navigation**  
   Shows how users move through the interface.  
   *Example: A sticky top menu bar ensures constant access to key sections.*

3. **Content Placement**  
   Organizes text, images, and media.  
   *Example: Hero section at the top immediately communicates the app's purpose.*

4. **Functionality**  
   Indicates interactive elements (buttons, forms, etc.).  
   *Example: A search bar wireframe shows its placement and expected behavior.*

## Types of Wireframes

### Low-Fidelity Wireframes
- **Purpose**: Early-stage layout planning  
- **Traits**: Placeholder text, boxes for images, no colors  
- **Tools**: Pen/paper, Figma (basic shapes)

### High-Fidelity Wireframes  
- **Purpose**: Client presentations, developer handoff  
- **Traits**: Real content, colors, interactive elements  
- **Tools**: Figma (detailed components)

### Wireframe Type Identification  
The Airbnb-like Figma file is **high-fidelity** because it includes:  
- Accurate spacing and typography  
- Branded colors and imagery  
- Functional prototype elements (e.g., clickable buttons)


## Wireframing Tools

### Figma (Recommended)
- **Collaboration**: Real-time multi-user editing  
- **Speed**: Drag-and-drop components for rapid wireframing  
- **Fidelity**: Scales from low-fi (boxes/placeholders) to high-fi (interactive prototypes)  
- **Access**: Free plan available, works in browsers  

*Why Figma for wireframing?*  
1. No installations needed  
2. Direct feedback via comments  
3. Auto-layout for responsive designs
